The **Pendle-YT-Timing-Strategy-Analyzer V6** is an enhanced tool designed to help DeFi users optimize their Yield Token (YT) investments on Pendle by analyzing real-time trade-by-trade data, predicting limit order completion times, and visualizing counterparty order density and wait times.

## üéØ Key Features in V6

- **Real-time Data Analysis**: Switch from hourly implied APY calculations to real-time trade-by-trade data, improving the accuracy of the YT fair value curve.
- **Enhanced Limit Order Placement Assistance**: Users can input the quantity of YT or PT they want to buy or sell. The system predicts how long it will take for the order to be filled based on market conditions.
- **Counterparty Order Density Visualization**: Visualizes the density of opposing orders and estimates wait times, assisting in more efficient order placements.
- **Customizable Indicators**: Retains the ability to add custom indicators like moving averages, volatility, RSI, and MACD for detailed strategy customization.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Provides more precise visualizations of the fair value curve, market trends, and simulated order outcomes.

## üîç Strategy Overview

The V6 strategy incorporates insights from implied APY and real-time YT price movements. Key updates include:

- **Fair Value Calculation**: Uses volume-weighted implied APY to calculate the fair price line for YT, adjusting for holding periods and market sentiment.
- **Optimized Timing**: Helps users identify the best purchase or sell times by comparing YT prices with their fair value. Users can balance between high-leverage, short-duration buys and low-leverage, long-duration holds.
  
For a full breakdown of the strategy, please refer to the [YT Timing Strategy Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MUHDZqcMZwv5h4CJwk_2LLev8zy6GjbSdevnAwpG0LE/edit?usp=sharing).

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `datetime`, `plotly`, `sklearn`, `tabulate`,`matplotlib`

## üìò Colab Notebook OR üöÄ Installation

You can explore the analysis directly on Google Colab, no setup required:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oD_czxq3yVFYXujP_n9dcbNJ1z7iqbLm?authuser=0#scrollTo=BEtIVZVI6elN)

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the analysis locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/labrinyang/Pendle-YT-Timing-Strategy-Analyzer.git
   ```
2. **Install the required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script locally and start your analysis.

## üí° Usage

1. **Select Network**: Choose the network where the pool is located (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mantle).
2. **Enter Contract Addresses**: Provide the Market and YT contract addresses on the pool's homepage.
3. **Analyze & Simulate**: Use the updated tool to analyze your investment strategy or simulate limit orders with real-time data.
4. **Visualize Results**: Generate updated visualizations to understand YT price movements, implied APY, and counterparty order distribution.
